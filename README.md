## Summary
Here, I have given two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for any other types of elections.

For example, if you wanted to do analysis a federal congressional election, all you need to do is change the counties to states. 
Another example, if you had a local initiative election, all you need to do is change candidates to in favor or against.
